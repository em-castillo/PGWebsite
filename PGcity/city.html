        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          On July 19, 1850, William H. Adams, John Mercer and Philo T.
          Farnsworth, Mormon pioneers sent by Brigham Young, arrived at the area
          now known as Pleasant Grove and staked out farms in what is now the
          southwest corner of the city. A small community was established
          September 13, 1850, consisting of George S. Clark and his wife,
          Susannah Dalley Clark, Richard and Ann Elizabeth Sheffer Clark, John
          Greenleaf Holman and Nancy Clark Holman, Lewis Harvey and his wife
          Lucinda Clark Harvey, Johnathan Harvey and Sarah Herbert Harvey,
          Charles Price and wife and child, Widow Harriet Marler and children,
          John Wilson, Ezekiel Holman, and possibly one or two others, relatives
          of those mentioned. Pleasant Grove was officially incorporated as a
          town January 18, 1855, by which time the settlement had grown to 623
          people.
        </p>
        <p>
          The original name of the city was Battle Creek. It was named for a
          battle which took place there in 1849 between Mormon settlers and a
          small band of Ute Indians. The settlers later decided they needed a
          more uplifting name and began calling their town Pleasant Grove after
          a grove of cottonwood trees located between Battle Creek and Grove
          Creek, near the current-day intersection of Locust Avenue and Battle
          Creek Drive. A monument with a plaque describing this battle is
          located at Kiwanis Park, at the mouth of Battle Creek Canyon.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the Walker Indian War in the 1850s, citizens built a fort with
          walls two or three feet thick and six feet tall that occupied an area
          the size of sixteen city blocks. The settlers in the area at the time
          built homes inside the fort. While the fort no longer stands, memorial
          cornerstones were erected by local historians. The northeast monument
          was erected near the intersection of 100 North and 300 East streets.
          The northwest monument was erected four blocks west of that point at
          100 West Street and the southeast monument erected four blocks south
          at 300 South Street. The southwest monument would have been located
          near 300 South 100 West, the area is now occupied by a large parking
          lot and retail store.

        <p>
          Today Pleasant Grove, Utah boasts a population of more than 35,000
          people. It is a vibrant community with citizens active in volunteer
          service and raising their families. They take pride in the
          beautification of their neighborhoods, parks and schools. Several
          traditional events occur annually such as Strawberry Days—a unique
          summer festival, running since 1921 featuring a rodeo, parades, a
          carnival, pageants and other activities, and the Heritage Jubilee—a
          celebration of the city’s founding, now going on 165 years!
        </p>

          Pleasant Grove City is primed for commercial growth and in recent
          years has welcomed large national and international businesses to its
          landscape, such as doTERRA and Close To My Heart. Its prime location
          and available properties along the I-15 corridor are situated nicely
          in Northern Utah County where the international tech-sector is
          exploding! With two major universities in the county—Utah Valley
          University and Brigham Young University—educational and recreational
          opportunities abound. Utah, itself, has been voted Best State for
          Business for five of the last six years by Forbes Magazine. The City
          and its residents are contributing to that business success. Pleasant
          Grove City is open for business growth!
